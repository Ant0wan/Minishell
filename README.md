# Minishell [![42](https://i.imgur.com/9NXfcit.jpg)](i.imgur.com/9NXfcit.jpg)


An implementation of some a simple start of a **shellscript** [a 42 project].

This project aims to get familiar with some of the core of the Unix system and explore an important part of the systemâ€™s API: process creation and synchronisation.

It implies to code in the cleanest and simplest manner


## Description



## Architecture

The following is the main steps in the minishell workflow:

- Input Stream

- Lexical Analysis

- Parsing

- Dispatcher

- Dispatcher

## General Architecture

```
```


## Lexical Analysis

	After the input stream has been capture. A raw string is passed to `function` for a lexical analysis. A process of tokenization takes place.

	> Each token is stored in a node of a linked-list.
	> Each token will be executed in a fork or as a builtin after been dispatched.

	Linked-list containing the tokens :
	```mermaid
	```


	And this will produce a flow chart:
